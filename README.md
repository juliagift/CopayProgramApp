# Copay Card Application

DESCRIPTION

This application simulates copay card operations which features role-based multiple dashboard access from a login page. Two roles are implemented, namely user and admin.

Users can:
* answer pre-screening questions before they can register
* register for a copay card
* login and get routed to a user dashboard
* submit and view claims
* edit and view profile
* delete account
* logout

Admin can:
* login and get routed to an admin dashboard
* view all patients and claims records
* logout

Once a userâ€™s account is deleted, they can no longer log back in. Their account information still persists in the database and can be accessed by the admin.
